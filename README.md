# client-boilerplate

A React starter boilerplate to speed up basic bootstraping of frontend applications and admin interfaces. Work in progress.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version Create React App docs [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Style guide

The style guide used is [standard.js](https://standardjs.com/). It can be run through `npm run format` manually, and it will be run automatically on `git commit`.
